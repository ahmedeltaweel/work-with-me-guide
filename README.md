# Work with me guide:

This document works as a manual for working with me. It should give a better sense of me and my values.

I really appreciate feedback anytimwe. So please use this form [here](https://forms.gle/S3MyHbvJRib85CPg7)to give me an anonymous one.

## How I communicate:
I am clearer in in-person than in writing. And if a meeting is required, it should have a clear agenda shared before it and preferably 30-40 mins max unless there is a big reason for more time. There is an exception for the agenda part if the reason of the meeting is to brainstorm with respect to timing and to have a documented outcome of the meeting.
When in a meeting or in an in-person talk and my point is not absolutely clear, please ask me to clarify or be precise with action items.

## Things I Do That May Annoy You:
1. I do not like ambiguity or assumptions. So, I will ask a lot of question and may ask the question again in differernt form to clarify more.
2. I will ask to document meeting takouts, tasks and decisions as a future reference.

## Things I do not like:
1. Rudeness, unfairness and being self-focused.
2. Fake compliments and hypocrisy.
3. In-direct speeking, feedback or opinion.
	
## Thinks I like:
1. I like short, precise and in-point stories, opinion or feedback.
2. I like providing help whenever I can. So do not hesitate to ask.
3. I do not say no to a cup of coffee with cookies, daunts, â€¦ etc with a friendly side-talk during the break in-person -if possible- or virtually.

## Things you can expect from me:
1. Direct, honest and fair opinion or feedback.
2. I will listen and take notes from what you say carfully. Then will give you an answer if I can or I will do some research and give you one later.
3. Sometimes I am to detailed.
