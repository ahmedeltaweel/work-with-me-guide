## Working with me: A guide
Welcome to this guide on working with me! My goal is to give you a better understanding of my values and how I like to communicate.

I really value constructive feedback, so please feel free to use this anonymous form [here](https://forms.gle/S3MyHbvJRib85CPg7) to share any thoughts or suggestions you have.

### The values that drive me include:
* Simplicity and realism.
* A focus on data-driven decision-making. I.e. In god, we trust, everyone else bring data.
* A sense of ownership and responsibility in my work, and a desire to share knowledge and support others.
* A commitment to 
  * continuous learning and development.
  * Up-skilling & Re-skilling & Rotating up.


### How I communicate:
In-person, I tend to be more clear in my communication than I am in writing. If we need to have a meeting, it's important to me that we have a clear agenda beforehand and that the meeting is no longer than 30-40 minutes, unless there is a specific reason for it to be longer. The only exception to this is if the purpose of the meeting is to brainstorm and document the outcomes. If I'm not being clear in a meeting or in-person conversation, please don't hesitate to ask me to clarify or be more specific with action items.

### Preferred means of communication:
- Work chat, if possible.
- Email at ahmed.m.eltaweel@outlook.com

### Things I do that may annoy you:
- I really dislike ambiguity or assumptions, so I may ask a lot of questions and repeat them in different ways to clarify things.
- I may ask for meeting takeaways, tasks, and decisions to be documented for future reference.

### Things I don't like:
- Rudeness, unfairness, and self-centered behavior.
- Fake compliments and hypocrisy.
- Indirect communication, unclear feedback, or fake opinions.

### Things I like:
I appreciate short, concise, and to-the-point stories, opinions, or feedback.
I enjoy helping out whenever I can, so don't hesitate to ask for help.
If possible, I'm always up for a coffee (with cookies, doughnuts, etc.) and a friendly chat during a break, either in-person or virtually.

### Things you can expect from me:
- Honest, direct, and fair opinions or feedback.
- I will listen carefully to what you have to say and take notes. If I can, I'll give you an answer right away. If not, I'll do some research and get back to you.
- Sometimes I can be very detailed in my communication.
